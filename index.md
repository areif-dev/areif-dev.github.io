## Self Assessment

Working through the Computer Science program at SNHU has helped me hone many skills that will serve me in a career in software engineering.

CS310 taught me how to communicate with a team and use Git version control to achieve a common goal with software.

CS260 taught me about data structures like Binary Search Trees and HashMaps, as well as algorithms like Binary Search and Merge Sort. While working on my CompSci Capstone, I also learned about cryptographic algorithms like AES, which I showcase in [Artifact 2](/artifacts/encryption).

I learned how to manage relational databases from courses like DAD220 while CS465 taught me how to manage NoSQL databases and how to interface with them from a full stack web application. Examples of my knowledge of various database systems can be found in [Artifact 3](/artifacts/fullstack-with-postgres) both pre and post enhancement.

Several classes taught me about software engineering including CS465 and CS360 where I developed an Android app for managing inventory. This project can be found in [Artifact 1](/artifacts/android-inventory).

I learned about security best practices like defense in depth, least privilege, and proper memory management from CS405. Some of my work on improving application security can be found in [Artifact 2](/artifacts/encryption).

Finally, I learned how to communicate with stakeholders in CS250 where I also learned about the software development lifecycle and the Agile development methodology. Examples of my ability to present software development in an approachable manner can be seen in all three artifacts.

## Code Review

In this video, I outline 3 projects I worked on in college. I discuss their shortcomings and how I intend to improve them as artifacts for this portfolio.

The first artifact I discuss is an [Android app for managing inventory](/artifacts/android-inventory). It began as a simple table with the ability to manually enter and count products. In my enhancements, I added the ability to scan barcodes to search the web for the description of the product and automatically count the product based on the number of times the barcode was scanned.

The second artifact I created was a very simple [encryption and decryption demo](/artifacts/encryption). The demo only used a xor operation against a random key and the input, which was not very secure, so the first enhancement I made to this program was to use a more secure symmetric encryption algorithm called AES-GCM. I also translated the program from C++ to Rust so the program would benefit from improved memory safety, and I turned the original program into a more general purpose command line app rather than just a one-off demonstration.

The final artifact that I discuss in the video is a [fullstack web application](/artifacts/fullstack-with-postgresql). The main enhancement that I made to this program was to move it from a MongoDB database to a PostgreSQL database to demonstrate my knowledge of relational databases.
